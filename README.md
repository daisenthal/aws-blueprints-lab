# üß≠ AWS AI + Data Blueprint Program  
*A hands-on architecture sprint using AWS CDK, Python, and CI/CD pipelines*

---

## üöÄ Overview
This repository is a structured, week-long journey to design, build, and deploy **real, scalable AWS AI architectures** ‚Äî not just demos.  
Each ‚Äúblueprint‚Äù is a **self-contained CDK project** that deploys, tests, and tears down cleanly.  
The goal: master AWS architecture through *repeatable, documented, and production-grade* scaffolds.

By the end of the program, you will have:
- Multiple deployable **AI-centric and data-driven blueprints**
- A consistent **Infrastructure-as-Code (CDK) foundation**
- Automated **CI/CD pipelines** (GitHub Actions + CodePipeline)
- Full **observability, scalability, and teardown discipline**
- A publishable methodology for **‚ÄúThe AWS AI Blueprint Method‚Äù**

## üß© Blueprint Series (Planned Order)

| # | Blueprint | Core Services | Purpose |
|---|------------|----------------|----------|
| 0 | **Foundation Setup** | CDK, Lambda, IAM | Establish base CDK environment & teardown flow |
| 1 | **AI Healthcheck API** | API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB, Bedrock | Deploy a REST endpoint that returns AI-based health insights |
| 2 | **AI Agent (CloudOps)** | Bedrock, Lambda, DynamoDB | Build an AWS-native agent that can query or act on resources |
| 3 | **Data Lake / ETL Pipeline** | S3, Glue, Athena, IAM | Create an ingestion and analytics workflow |
| 4 | **Streaming Analytics** | Kinesis, Lambda, CloudWatch | Real-time event processing with metrics |
| 5 | **Observability & Security Layer** | CloudWatch, X-Ray, KMS, Cognito | Harden, monitor, and secure the stacks |

Each blueprint lives in its own folder (e.g., `01_ai_healthcheck_api/`) and can be deployed or destroyed independently.
